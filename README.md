# Kickstarting with Excel
## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**
The purpose of the project is to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The line chart shows us that most of the theatre projects were successfully completed, with very few cancellations. We can see an upward trend of successful projects during summer months between April and August, with thr highest being in May. October shows no cancelled projects. In December there was almost equal amounts of failed and successful theatre projects. Summer months have proven to be the best time to launch theatre projects which can be linked to summer vacations.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The line chart shows us the percentage of successful, failed and cancelled plays between different ranges of monetary goals for the project. We see that there were 0% cancelled plays which shows all were attempted. Between the ranges of $0 and $29,999 we see a steady decline in number of successful plays.  100% of plays which fell in the range $45,000 - $49,999 failed. However, overall, it looks like most plays were successfull.

- What are the two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The highest success was found in the Month of May
2. October had no cancelled projects

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
No play was cancelled, which shows all were attempted. Overall, majority of the plays were succesful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There still isn't enough data displayed to determine a concrete conclusion of the results. The dataset doesn't show any outliers or information that can help us determine the cause and relation of the way the line chart displays the data. It is difficult to determine the root cause of the problem of failed data.

-What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Bar graphs and pie charts can be used to help visualize the data and see the differences more clearly. Box and whisker graph can help us determine any outliers which can help us analyze those outliers to determine the possible problems of why some of the projects werent successful.
